# Get Started with Chat Using Azure AI Foundry

MENU: [**PREREQUISITES**](#prerequisites) \| [**DEVELOPMENT**](#development)  \| [**DEPLOYMENT**](#deployment)  \| [**TRACING AND MONITORING**](#tracing-and-monitoring)  \| [**DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS**](#development-options)  \| [**SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION**](#supporting-documentation) 

This solution contains a simple chat application that is deployed to Azure Container Apps.This solution also creates an Azure AI Foundry hub, project and connected resources including Azure AI Services, AI Search and more.
The main path walks you through deploying the application using local development environment. After the local development environment instructions, there are also instructions for developing in GitHub Codespaces and VS Code Dev Containers.

## Prerequisites

#### Azure account
If you do not have an Azure Subscription, you can sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and create an Azure Subscription.

**NOTE!** Whether you sign up for a new account, or use an existing subscription, check that you have the necessary permissions and quotas:

* Your Azure account for the Azure Subscription that you are using must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner).
* Your Azure account also needs `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permissions on the subscription level.
* Check that the account has quotas to deploy the desired chat and embedding model and the model is [available at the region](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models?tabs=global-standard%2Cstandard-embeddings#model-summary-table-and-region-availability), where the Azure AI Foundry is being created.

You can view the permissions for your account and subscription by going to Azure portal, clicking 'Subscriptions' under 'Navigation' and then choosing your subscription from the list. If you try to search for your subscription and it does not come up, make sure no filters are selected. After selecting your subscription, select 'Access control (IAM)' and you can see the roles that are assigned to your account for this subscription. If you want to see more information about the roles, you can go to the 'Role assignments' tab and search by your account name and then click on the role you want to view more information about.

#### Required tools
Make sure the following tools are installed:

1. [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd) Install or update to the latest version. Instructions can be found on the linked page.
2. [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Development

#### Code
Download the project code:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/get-started-with-ai-chat.git
```
At this point you could make changes to the code if required. However, no changes are needed to deploy and test the app as shown in the next step.

#### Logging
If you want to enable logging to a file, uncomment the following line in Dockerfile located in the src directory:

 ```
 ENV APP_LOG_FILE=app.log
 ```

 By default the file name app.log is used. You can provide your own file name by replacing app.log with the desired log file name.

 **NOTE!** Any changes to the Dockerfile require a re-deployment in order for the changes to take effect.

The provided file logging implementation is intended for development purposes only, specifically for testing with a single client/worker. It should not be used in production environments after the R&D phase.

#### Tracing to Azure Monitor
To enable tracing to Azure Monitor, modify the value of ENABLE_AZURE_MONITOR_TRACING environment variable to true in Dockerfile found in src directory:
```code
ENV ENABLE_AZURE_MONITOR_TRACING=true
```
Note that the optional App Insights resource is required for tracing to Azure Monitor (it is created by default).

To enable message contents to be included in the traces, set the following environment variable to true in the same Dockerfile. Note that the messages may contain personally identifiable information.

```code
ENV AZURE_TRACING_GEN_AI_CONTENT_RECORDING_ENABLED=true
```

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
 
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) feature helps improve the responses from your application by combining the power of large language models (LLMs) with extra context retrieved from an external data source. Simply put, when you ask a question, the application first searches through a set of relevant documents (stored as embeddings) and then uses this context to provide a more accurate and relevant response. If no relevant context is found, the application returns the LLM response directly.
 
This feature is enabled by default. To configure or disable the RAG feature in your application, please refer to the following detailed documentation:
 
**[Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Setup Guide](docs/RAG.md)**

## Deployment

1. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

2. (Optional) If you would like to customize the deployment to [disable resources](docs/deploy_customization.md#disabling-resources), [customize resource names](docs/deploy_customization.md#customizing-resource-names),
or [customize the models](docs/deploy_customization.md#customizing-model-deployments), you can follow those steps now.

3. Provision and deploy all the resources by running the following in get-started-with-ai-chat directory:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

    It will prompt you to provide an `azd` environment name (like "azureaiapp"), select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a location which has quota for all the resources. Then it will provision the resources in your account and deploy the latest code. If you get an error or timeout with deployment, changing the location can help, as there may be availability constraints for the resources.

    **NOTE!** If you get authorization failed and/or permission related errors during the deployment, please refer to the Azure account requirements in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

4. When `azd` has finished deploying, you'll see an endpoint URI in the command output. Visit that URI, and you should see the app! üéâ
   You can view information about your deployment with:
    ```shell
    azd show
    ```


5. If you make further modification to the app code, you can deploy the updated version with:

    ```shell
    azd deploy
    ```
    You can get more detailed output with the ```--debug``` parameter.
    ```shell
    azd deploy --debug
    ```
    Check for any errors during the deployment, since updated app code will not get deployed if errors occur.

‚ö†Ô∏è To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

## Tracing and Monitoring

You can view console logs in Azure portal. You can get the link to the resource group with the azd tool:
```shell
azd show
```

Or if you want to navigate from the Azure portal main page, select your resource group from the 'Recent' list, or by clicking the 'Resource groups' and searching your resource group there.

After accessing you resource group in Azure portal, choose your container app from the list of resources. Then open 'Monitoring' and 'Log Stream'.

If you enabled logging to a file, you can view the log file by choosing 'Console' under the 'Monitoring' (same location as above for the console traces), opening the default console and then for example running the following command (replace app.log with the actual name of your log file):

```shell
more app.log
```

You can view the App Insights tracing in Azure AI Foundry. Select your project on the Azure AI Foundry page and then click 'Tracing'.

## Development Options

In addition to the development setup documented above, the following development environment options can be used.

<details>
  <summary><b>Local Development Server</b></summary>

#### Local Development Server

You can optionally use a local development server to test app changes locally. Make sure you first [deployed the app](#deployment) to Azure before running the development server.

1. Create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) and activate it.

    On Windows:

    ```shell
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\scripts\activate
    ```

    On Linux:

    ```shell
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. Navigate to the `src` directory:

    ```shell
    cd src
    ```

3. Install required Python packages:

    ```shell
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Tracing and logging:

    To enable logging to a file, add the `APP_LOG_FILE` environment variable definition to the `.env` file in the `src` directory. See [Logging](#logging) for more information. As an example, to log to a file named `app.log` add the following to the `.env` file:
    ```code
    APP_LOG_FILE=app.log
    ```

    To enable Azure Monitor tracing, add the `ENABLE_AZURE_MONITOR_TRACING` and `AZURE_TRACING_GEN_AI_CONTENT_RECORDING_ENABLED` environment variable definitions to the `.env` file in the `src` directory. See [Tracing to Azure Monitor](#tracing-to-azure-monitor) for more information. As an example, to enable tracing to Azure Monitor without tracing message contents, add the following to the '.env' file:
    ```code
    ENABLE_AZURE_MONITOR_TRACING=true
    AZURE_TRACING_GEN_AI_CONTENT_RECORDING_ENABLED=false
    ```

5. Run the local server:

    ```shell
    python -m uvicorn "api.main:create_app" --factory --reload
    ```

6. Click 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' in the terminal, which should open a new tab in the browser.

7. Enter your message in the box.

#### Security guidelines

This template uses Azure AI Foundry connections to communicate between resources, which stores keys in Azure Key Vault.
This template also uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for local development and deployment.

To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

* Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud to [secure your Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/defender-for-cloud).
* Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).
